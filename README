PDP10-EXPERIMENTS
=================

This is a collection of experimental code snippets for programming the PDP-10,
specifically the KL10B, primarily but not exclusively in exec mode.

Snippets
--------

console/
	A standalone exec mode program to initialize the DTE20
	and then print an ASCII string to the console.

timer/
	A standalone exec mode program to set up interval counter
	interrupts and use those to trigger output to the console.

Dependencies
------------

To build and run these snippets you'll need:

- the PDP-10 port of GNU binutils; see https://github.com/mikpe/binutils-gdb/tree/pdp10
- the pdp10-unknown-elf-elf2boot utility; see https://github.com/mikpe/pdp10-tools.git
- the klh10 emulator built for the KL10B, kn10-kl; see https://github.com/PDP-10/klh10.git
